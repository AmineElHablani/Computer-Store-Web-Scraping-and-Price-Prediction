# Computer Store Web Scraping and Price Prediction

This repository contains scripts and notebooks for scraping computer data from an online store, performing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models for computer prices using various machine learning techniques. It involves the following key steps:

## Key Steps

- **Web Scraping**: Python script to scrape computer data (price and 29 features) from an online store.
  
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Preparation of scraped data for analysis and modeling, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features using both Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploration of relationships between features and price using statistical methods like ANOVA tests to find significant correlations.

- **Model Building**: Training multiple machine learning models including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ridge Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, XGBoost, ElasticNet Regression, Bayesian Regression, and a Neural Network.

- **Model Evaluation**: Comparison of models using metrics such as R-squared score and Mean Absolute Error to determine the most robust model and methodology (Label Encoding vs. One-Hot Encoding).
